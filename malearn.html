								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Linear Regression</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Statistical Tests help us understand the data we collect and make inferences. Typically, they are used to examine relationships between variables and test hypotheses. In other words, they are a way of analyzing dadta to see if there is a significant difference between groups. Linear Regression, our chosen statistical test, helps us find a relationship between the predictors and a response variable. What we are trying to do is to create a line of best fit. Naturally, since this a linear regression, we are attempting to find a linear relationship.</p>
									
									<img src="images/lr1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">This is one of our linear regression models. The predictor is <b>engagement</b> and the response variable is <date>. Just from looking at the graph, we can see that the data follows a linear path, as shown by the dotted line. Of course, there are a few outliers here and there, but it mostly fits a linear relationship between the predictor and the response variable.</p>
									<img src="images/lr2.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">After running our code, it can be observed that our linear regression has a <b>root mean squared error (RMSE)</b> of <b>87.2</b> and a <b>coefficient of determination</b> of <b>R2</b>. Additionally, our <b>p-value</b> is around <b>0.044</b>. Again, it is less than 0.05 and so it can be said that there is a significant relationship between tweet count and the date as well.</p>

									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">This is our other linear regression model. The predictor is <b>tweet count</b> and the response variable remains the same. Just from looking at the graph once more, we can see that the data follows a linear path. After running our code, it can be observed that our <b>p-value</b> is around <b>0.024</b>. Since it is less than 0.05, our significance level, it can be said that there is a significant relationship between engagement and the date.</p>

								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Event Detection</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Event Detection is a type of machine learning model that helps in identifying trends and events. For our study, we aim to identify events that have caused peaks in our data, specifically what causes misinformation about COVID-19 home remedies and techniques to rise.</p>				

									<img src="images/ed1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">Our event detection model uses <b>tweet count</b> and <b>date</b> as variables. The dotted lines represent the change in trend, in which two occur on <b>June, 5, 2020</b> and <b>February 28, 2022</b>. The red cross symbols represent the peaks in our data. Here are the events based on the model:</p>					
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify"><b>March 2020</b>: President Duterte imposes the first nationwide lockdown shortly after the first local transmission in the Philippines.</p>	
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify"><b>March 2021</b>: Cases finally reach the one million mark, and the first batches of the vaccines roll in.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify"><b>August 2021</b>: The Delta variant of COVID-19 has become the dominant coronavirus in the Philippines.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify"><b>January 2022</b>: President Duterte imposes the first nationwide lockdown shortly after the first local transmission in the Philippines.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">In short, these events caused a change in the number of misinformation tweets being posted. The first dotted line shows a change in trend with the sudden drop of tweets after a few months into the pandemic, whereas the second dotted line represents the change in trend after around a year into the pandemic and when more minor events and circumstances such as vaccine drives and case counts.</p>
