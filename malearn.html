								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Linear Regression</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Statistical Tests help us understand the data we collect and make inferences. Typically, they are used to examine relationships between variables and test hypotheses. In other words, they are a way of analyzing dadta to see if there is a significant difference between groups. Linear Regression, our chosen statistical test, helps us find a relationship between the predictors and a response variable. What we are trying to do is to create a line of best fit. Naturally, since this a linear regression, we are attempting to find a linear relationship.</p>
									
									<img src="images/lr1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">This is one of our linear regression models. The predictor is <b>engagement</b> and the response variable is <date>. Just from looking at the graph, we can see that the data follows a linear path, as shown by the dotted line. Of course, there are a few outliers here and there, but it mostly fits a linear relationship between the predictor and the response variable.</p>
									<img src="images/lr2.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">After running our code, it can be observed that our linear regression has a <b>root mean squared error (RMSE)</b> of <b>87.2</b> and a <b>coefficient of determination</b> of <b>R2</b>. Additionally, our <b>p-value</b> is around <b>0.044</b>. Again, it is less than 0.05 and so it can be said that there is a significant relationship between tweet count and the date as well.</p>

									<img src="images/lr4.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">This is our other linear regression model. The predictor is <b>tweet count</b> and the response variable remains the same. Just from looking at the graph once more, we can see that the data follows a linear path. After running our code, it can be observed that our <b>p-value</b> is around <b>0.024</b>. Since it is less than 0.05, our significance level, it can be said that there is a significant relationship between engagement and the date.</p>

								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Feature Distribution</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Numerical Features</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We used <b>Seaborn</b> to observe the distribution of our numerical features (<i>Following, Followers, Likes, Replies, Retweets, Days Since First Case (21/01/20)</i>) via scatterplots and histograms.</p>
									<img src="images/scatterhist.png" width="800" height="800" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We observed that most of our samples occur in the <b>0-200</b> and <b>400-600</b> range of Days Since First Case. This observation, in particular, can be observed via the bottom rightmost histogram.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We also observed that engagement is mostly low or 0 (from likes and replies) but we see a <b>general downward trend</b> with retweets.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Numerical Feature Correlation</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Again, we used <b>Seaborn</b>, this time to plot a heat map and observe the correlation of the numerical features with each other.</p>
									<img src="images/heatmap.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">As expected, there is a <b>positive correlation</b> between the number of followers and engagements (likes, replies, and retweets). Furthermore, there is also a <b>positive correlation</b> between the engagement metrics. The number of following accounts has not much correlation to other values. The same is observed with the days since first case.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Group Comparison</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">This time, we used <b>Matplotlib</b> to plot bar and swarm plots to compare and contrast the different fields.</p>
									<img src="images/bar1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can observe that there are more <b>anonymous</b> accounts than identified accounts.</p>
									<img src="images/bar2.png" align="center" width="700" height="400"/>
									<img src="images/swarm.png" align="center" width="550" height="400"/>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can observe that there are more followers for <b>identified</b> and <b>media</b> accounts than anonymous accounts. Through the swarm plot, we can also observe that the media accounts have <b>more followers</b> compared to anonymous and identified accounts. There is also a similar pattern for the anonymous and identified types in they both have more accounts with followers in the <b>100-1000</b> range. These were done in a logarithmic scale to minimize the size of the graph while still keeping it accurate.</p>
								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: -10px">Time Series</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We return to using <b>Seaborn</b> to create a line plot to observe the trends from a time-series analysis perspective.</p>
									<img src="images/lineplot.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">It can be observed that there are <b>3</b> obvious peaks, specifically <b>2</b> between the <b>0-200</b> range and <b>1</b> between the <b>400-500</b> range.</p>
									<img src="images/lineplot2.png" align="center" width="800" height="400"/>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can see that more tweets occurred in the early stages of the pandemic, specifically between <b>January 2020</b> and <b>May 2020</b>, with a few smaller peaks here and there after.</p>
