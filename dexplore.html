						<h1 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS"><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong></h1>
					</header>
								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Cleaning the Dataset</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Before we started making visual charts and graphs to observe patterns and trends, we started to clean the data first. Cleaning the data is necessary in order to maximize our productivity and provide better quality information. This way, we can easily visualize without having to worry about missing or incorrect data.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Removing Non-essential Columns</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We removed non-essential columns to our time-series analysis, such as <b>ID, Timestamp, Group, Collector, Topic, Category, Remarks</b> and <b>Remarks</b>. These fields were not necessary and were thus dropped. We left the other columns in our dataset since we wanted to observe if they may influence the distribution of our data.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Missing Values and Encoding Values</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Our dataset has missing values in the <b>Location</b> and <b>Account Bio</b> columns. We filled this in by encoding <b>1</b> for if there was a location or an account bio and <b>0</b> if the field was empty. We also encoded other fields as well to make it more convenient for us to manipulate in our code.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We split the <b>Tweet Type</b> column based on the unique variables contained within (<i>URL, Reply, Image, Video</i>). We left <i>Text</i> out since every sample is of that type. After separating it into other columns, we then encoded it so that the columns' values would be <b>1</b> if it was of that type and <b>0</b> if not. A similar process was done to the <b>Content Type</b> column, which split into the <i>Rational, Emotional</i> and <i>Transactional</i> columns.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Handling Outliers</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We needed to check for outliers to make sure that our data would not be skewed. By getting the standard deviation and z-scores of our data, we observed that we had a few outliers, particularly in the engagement metrics (<i>likes, retweets, replies</i>).</p>
									<img src="images/box1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">They are few in number, but may skew our data greatly, so we dropped these values.</p>
									<img src="images/box2.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px">Format Consistency</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We manually corrected and re-edited the values in our fields to clean it up more, such as correcting typos, removing whitespace to avoid repetition of unique values (the dataset recognizes "Identified" and "Identified " as two separate values, for instance), and edited the formatting of the dates and times in the dataset for easier access if we needed to manipulate them.</p>

								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New">Feature Distribution</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Numerical Features</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We used <b>Seaborn</b> to observe the distribution of our numerical features (<i>Following, Followers, Likes, Replies, Retweets, Days Since First Case (21/01/20)</i>) via scatterplots and histograms.</p>
									<img src="images/scatterhist.png" width="800" height="800" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We observed that most of our samples occur in the <b>0-200</b> and <b>400-600</b> range of Days Since First Case. This observation, in particular, can be observed via the bottom rightmost histogram.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We also observed that engagement is mostly low or 0 (from likes and replies) but we see a <b>general downward trend</b> with retweets.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Numerical Feature Correlation</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">Again, we used <b>Seaborn</b>, this time to plot a heat map and observe the correlation of the numerical features with each other.</p>
									<img src="images/heatmap.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">As expected, there is a <b>positive correlation</b> between the number of followers and engagements (likes, replies, and retweets). Furthermore, there is a <b>low positive correlation</b> between the engagement metrics. The number of following accounts has not much correlation to other values. The same is observed with the days since first case.</p>
									<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: -10px">Group Comparison</p>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">This time, we used <b>Matplotlib</b> to plot bar and swarm plots to compare and contrast the different fields.</p>
									<img src="images/bar1.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can observe that there are more <b>anonymous</b> accounts than identified accounts.</p>
									<img src="images/bar2.png" align="center" width="700" height="400"/>
									<img src="images/swarm.png" align="center" width="550" height="400"/>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can observe that there are more followers for <b>identified</b> and <b>media</b> accounts than anonymous accounts. Through the swarm plot, we can also observe that the media accounts have <b>more followers</b> compared to anonymous and identified accounts. There is also a similar pattern for the anonymous and identified types in they both have more accounts with followers in the <b>100-1000</b> range. These were done in a logarithmic scale to minimize the size of the graph while still keeping it accurate.</p>
								<h3 style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: -10px">Time Series</h3>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New" align="justify">We return to using <b>Seaborn</b> to create a line plot to observe the trends from a time-series analysis perspective.</p>
									<img src="images/lineplot.png" align="center" />
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">It can be observed that there are <b>3</b> obvious peaks, specifically <b>2</b> between the <b>0-200</b> range and <b>1</b> between the <b>400-500</b> range.</p>
									<img src="images/lineplot2.png" align="center" width="800" height="400"/>
									<p style="font-family: Courier New; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We can see that more tweets occurred in the early stages of the pandemic, specifically between <b>January 2020</b> and <b>May 2020</b>, with a few smaller peaks here and there after.</p>
