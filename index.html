						<h2 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Here's an overview of our project.</h2>
						
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS" align="justify">Misinformation has always been a huge problem when it comes to social media, particularly because people tend to accept what they read for what it is, without choosing to check if the information shared is correct. Because of the panic during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, many people have been desperate for remedies and prevention techniques that they can do from home without spending excessive amounts of money. This eventually lead to them sharing the rumored techniques, secrets and discoveries that can supposedly help which further led to mass sharing of such misinformation.</p>
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">We chose to analyze this topic specifically because the pandemic has impacted all of our lives, changing it drastically. It further brought to light how many people can be easily deceived or given false hope via misinformation. Through this project, our goal is to find out when was the spread of fake home remedies and techniques more likely to happen and what factors are involved.</p>

						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px"><strong>Research Question: When did tweets about Covid home remedies/prevention techniques become more likely to go viral in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic in the Philippines?</strong></p>

			<!-- Results -->
			<article id="results" class="wrapper style1">
				<div class="container">
					<header>
						<h2 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Here's what we found out.</h2>
					</header>
					
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS" align="justify">From exploring the data, we discovered that there were more <b>anonymous</b> accounts than <b>media</b> or <b>identified</b>. This has to do with the way Twitter functions. Since it is not required to identify yourself on the platform, username and unrelated display names are far more common, making it difficult to identify the individuals behind the accounts. Furthermore, it is observed that there are far more misinformation tweets in the early months of the pandemic, before slowing down and experiencing small spikes after.</p>
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">From our statistical test and machine learning model, we found that <b>date</b> has a linear relationship with <b>engagement</b> and <b>tweet count</b>. We also found that there were four distinct peaks over the course of the pandemic where there were more misinformation tweets than average. More peaks occurred in <b>2021</b>, but the highest peak occurred on <b>March 2020</b>.</p>
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">To reiterate the results from our event detection model, the highest peak occurred on March 2020, when President Rodrigo Duterte first places the Philippines under lockdown due to the first local transmission of the coronavirus. At this moment in time, panic and anxiety worsened. With no vaccines or cures in sight, it <i>led many people to speculate and search for supposed home remedies that could prevent or cure COVID-19</i>. The next peak occurred on March 2021, a year after the first peak. However, there are significantly less tweets due to <i>having more time for known health authorities to spread more information about the virus and what to do</i>. This was also the time that the country hit one million cases and also when vaccines started to roll in. However, there was still a noticeable rise in tweets since <i>many people may doubt the vaccines' effectiveness, especially for the vaccine-averse or from misinformation being spread by anti-vaxxers</i>. The next peak occurs on August 2021, when the Delta variant becomes the dominant strain of the virus in the Philippines. <i>Increasing unrest and worry resulted in more tweets</i>. The last peak occurs on January 2022, with the Omicron variant spreading and a medicine shortage occurring. <i>With medicine being out of reach for the time being, many turn to home remedies</i>.</p>
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">These findings emphasize that <b>misinformation spread during the earlier years of the pandemic, decreasing in engagement as time passed due to misinformation countermeasures</b>. Furthermore, the significant relationship between the date and engagement and tweet count allows us to reject our null hypothesis.</p>
						<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; margin-top: 20px" align="justify">For future steps in the event this study is expanded upon or continued, our recommendations would be to look into more specific events causing the misinformation and to collect more samples in order to identify other minor events and improve the research. Additionally, the virality of certain keywords in relation to false home remedies can be looked into more.</p>
